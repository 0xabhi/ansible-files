- name: Simple Example Playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Install a package
      apt:
        name: curl
        state: present

    - name: Create a directory
      file:
        path: /tmp/mydir
        state: directory

    - name: Create a file
      file:
        path: /tmp/mydir/myfile.txt
        state: touch

root@ip-10-0-1-145:/# ansible-playbook file1.yml --start-at-task="Create a directory"


so in the above playbook the tasks will execute from the second task i.e form " Create a direcroty " 

it will ignore the first task i.e install a package
